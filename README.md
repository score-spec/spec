## ![Score](/docs/images/logo.svg) What is Score?

Score is an open source, platform-agnostic, container-based workload specification. This means you can define your workload once with the _Score Specification_ and then use a _Score Implementation_ CLI to translate it to multiple platforms, such as Helm, Docker Compose or Google Cloud Run.

In the example below, a `score.yaml` file is executed via [score-compose](https://github.com/score-spec/score-compose/tree/main/examples) to generate a `compose.yaml` file, which allows the user to spin up a container via Docker Compose. The same `score.yaml` file is then used to generate a helm `values.yaml` file to be installed onto Kubernetes.

This project aims to reduce developer toil and cognitive load by only having to define a single yaml file that works across multiple platforms.

Score helps to improve the developer experience by being combined with other workflows and is not meant to replace yaml. Infrastructure and development teams can use this specification to improve workflows throughout their organization.

Using Score provides the following advantages:

- The developer only needs to learn the _Score Specification_ to define the workloads that run across all these platforms.
- The _Score Specification_ is designed to be applied to multiple environments to reduce the amount of configuration.
- An infrastructure team can help define and configure the resources and multiple platforms where the developer can work on.

At this time Score is still in alpha, but we are hoping for it to quickly grow its implementation use cases through community contributions.

## ![Score](/docs/images/logo.svg) Why Score?

Cloud native developers often struggle with configuration inconsistencies between environments. This gets even more complicated when the technology stack in each environment is different. What if you use Docker Compose for local development, but Helm Charts to deploy to the Kubernetes based development environment?

Not only do you have to figure out Docker Compose and Helm, but you need to keep them in sync!

This results in various bottlenecks along the application delivery lifecycle.

  ðŸŽµ Tech & tools that require specialized knowledge and operational expertise are imposed on developers.

  ðŸŽµ Different configuration rules, constructs and values between local and remote environments increase the risk of configuration inconsistencies.

  ðŸŽµ Keeping a multitude of platform- and environment-specific configuration files in sync leads to repetitive configuration work.

Score provides a single, easy to understand specification for each workload that describes its runtime requirements in a declarative manner. The `score.yaml` file allows to generate configuration in an automated, standardized and one directional way.

By reducing the risk of wrongly specified or inconsistent configuration between environments are we hoping to foster focus and joy for developers in their day-to-day work.

## ![Score](/docs/images/logo.svg) How does Score work?

![how-score-works](/docs/images/how-score-works.png)

As shown in the graphic above, are there 3 core components to consider in the context of Score:

The _Score Specification_ file is a platform-agnostic workload specification which can be run against a _Score Implementation_ (CLI) such as [score-compose](https://github.com/score-spec/score-compose) or [score-helm](https://github.com/score-spec/score-helm) to generate a platform configuration file such as `docker-compose.yaml` or a helm `values.yaml` file.
The generated configuration file can then be combined with environment-specific parameters to run the workload in the target environment.

## ![Installation](/docs/images/install.svg) Installation

To install a _Score Implementation_, see the installation guide in each repository:

- [score-compose](https://github.com/score-spec/score-compose#-installation)
- [score-helm](https://github.com/score-spec/score-helm#-installation)
- [score-humanitec](https://github.com/score-spec/score-humanitec#-installation)
- For linux based systems, run this script on your CLI:  
  "curl -L https://github.com/score-org/score-cli/releases/download/v1.0.0/score-cli_1.0.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin/" 

Can't find the implementation you are looking for? The Score Specification has the potential to integrate with many container orchestration platforms and tooling such as Kustomize, Amazon ECS, Google Cloud Run, or Nomad.
