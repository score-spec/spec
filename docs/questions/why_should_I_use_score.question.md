Score helps to improve the developer experience by being combined with other workflows, and is not meant to replace yaml. Infrastructure and development teams can use this specification to improve workflows throughout their organization.

Using Score provides the following advantages:

- The developer only needs to learn the _Score Specification_ to define the workloads that run across all these platforms.
- The _Score Specification_ is designed to be applied to multiple environments to reduce the amount of configuration.
- An infrastructure team can help define and configure the resources and multiple platforms where the developer can work on.
