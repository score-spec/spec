Score is an open source, platform-agnostic, container-based workload specification. This means you can define your workload once with the Score Specification and then use a Score Implementation CLI to translate it to multiple platforms, such as Helm, Docker Compose or Google Cloud Run. Score aims to reduce developer toil and cognitive load by only having to define a single yaml file that works across multiple platforms.
